This program allows to download all files from a given project.

To start create a new project setting:

- Name: local project name to identify it
- Api Token: remote project Api Token that will be used to download the files
- Target Folder: sets the location where all the files will be downloaded

Every project enables 3 functions:

- Sync: aligns the local downloaded files with the remote files
- Edit: changes the config properties (name/api token/download folder)
- Delete: deletes the config and all the relative local files and folders
